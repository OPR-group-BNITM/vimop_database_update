# ViMOP database setup

This repository contains scripts and documentation on how to setup the OPR ViMOP database.
The datatabase has three independent compentents

- the virus reference genomes
- the centifuge index
- the host genomes

They are updated independently.
Hence, this repository has three sub-directories.
Find a README in each of the subdirectories called `virus`, `centrifuge` and `host` with documentation on how to setup and update the database.
